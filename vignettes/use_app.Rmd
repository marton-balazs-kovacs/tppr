The `tppr` package can be used as a web application. The application real-time tracks the collected data for the project and summarises the results. You can check the deployed version of the app here:

If you want to instead run the app locally from your computer, first you have to open R and install the `tppr` package with the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("marton-balazs-kovacs/tppr")
```

After the installation finishes, you can launch the app locally.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tppr::run_app()
```

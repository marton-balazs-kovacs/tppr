\title{Exploratory analysis}
\usage{
analysis_exploratory(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{tibble}
}
\value{
The function returns a list of three, the possible success
rates, the the proportion of observed successful guess rate, and the
proportion of proportion of simulated successful guess rate.
}
\description{
This function runs the exploratory analysis that
aims to explore the empirical distribution of successful
guess rate in the population, by contrasting it to a theoretical
distribution expected if the true successful guess chance is homogeneously
50% in the population. This may provide information for future research on
potential irregularities in the distribution of guess rates.
